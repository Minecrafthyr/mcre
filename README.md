- Way to store experience
- Sieve ? (I think only scaffolding like that, but needs to change texture because bamboo is not a very common item let us craft it.)

### The story of this project

[Back to Menu](#menu)

This project is planned 3 years ago, that time I can feel Minecraft is not balanced, but I don't know how to modify Minecraft elements.  
So, I started to study how to made a datapack, a simple way to modify Minecraft.  
Then I created this project, change and add lots of files to make Minecraft more realistic.  
I did it a few months ago, even did some mod-supports, but there are too many (1000+) files, makes me nervous if the project is balanced.  
Then I review and rewrite the whole project. I've learned a lot of new things during rewriting.  
That's today's Minecraft Remade.
